# Beyond-Status-Quo

Mission Statement: Hi we are Beyond Status Quo. The inspiration behind our creation comes from founder Lakshya Rajoria who describes coming from New York and debating at the National level gave him the opportunity to learn so much about the world, to be able to articulate his ideas and to make himself heard. That’s why we developed Beyond Status Quo, we realized that there isn’t any platform right now that would allow one to see all the opportunities to showcase their talents of argumentation or even to experience and learn from events that are happening around them. Thus, in the hope of bringing to others a platform for debating, for creating connections throughout our school, city, state and one day throughout the country we created Beyond Status Quo. Through our platform users can create tournaments anywhere in India, and host them, they can create schools and store all their budding debaters and judges information as well as see results of all of their tournaments. Let’s work together to promote discourse, reach those of less privilege, and learn more about our own capabilities.
